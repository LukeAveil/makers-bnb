My first group project at Makers Academy, to build a clone of AirBnB.

In a group with four other peers, we had 1 week to implement the following user stories.

The idea was to but into practise the skills we have developed over the past 5 weeks, and if we wanted we could try and integrate new technologies. We decided to stick with what we felt most comfortable with and used Sinatra, Ruby, HTML, CSS and jQuery.

We had completed a MVP by close of play on Thursday, Friday was spent refining design and the UI along with implementing a payment system and chat facility.


### User Stories

As a user

I would like to provide a name, description and price for each space

As a user
so that a space is only hired when it is available
I would like to specify a range of dates on which a space is available

As a user
so that I can hire a space when I want
I would like to request to hire any space for one night

As a user
so that I can only hire out my space if I want to
I would like to approve requests before a space is hired

As a user
so that spaces are unable to be double-booked
I would like a space to be unavailable for booking if already booked

As a user

I would like a space to remain available for booking until a request is confirmed
